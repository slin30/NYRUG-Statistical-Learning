#### Overview
This github repository is aimed at serving as a playground for the NY R User Group members participating in the NY Open Data Science Statistical Learning study group. This repo will be used by the members to post code, data sets, and presentations. Syntax files will be geared towards solutions to the labs presented in the book, along with approaches to machine and statistical learning problems they're working on. Submitted data will be open-source data sets and will typically be submitted by the individual who will be presenting next. Presentations will follow this format: submitted only be a presenter around the time of the next meetup.

#### Structure
Each individual should clone this repo to their personal computer and make a pull request before every submit. In addition, each member should create their own folder which hold three subfolders: data, code, presentation. This will make it easier for members to find information they're looking for and will also reduce clutter on the initial landing page. Once these folders are created, issue a pull request and I will merge it to the main branch and add you as a member. 

#### Questions
All questions should be posted in the [Issues](https://github.com/theRanalyst/NYRUG-Statistical-Learning/issues) section.
